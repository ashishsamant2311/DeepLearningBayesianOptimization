Created a Keras based Neural Network for multi-class classification. 
Utilized the Fashion_MNIST Dataset from Keras.
The aim of the exercise was to start off with a basic classifier and eventually incorporate various improvements.
Explored the following
<ol>
  <li> Different types of Optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, AdamW, Momentum, SGD)</li>
  <li> Batch Normalization</li>
  <li> Kernel Regularization (L2)</li>
  <li> Kernel Initializers (Glorot, He_Normal) </li>
  <li> Early stopping</li>
  <li> Learning rate decay</li>
  <li> Bayesian Optimization for best parameters</li>
</ol>
